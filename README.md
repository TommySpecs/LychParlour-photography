## ***User Experience Design (UXD)***

Websites are designed to be accessible for all. LychParlour Photography has been looked at and designed in a way to be accesssible.

This is from layout decisions colour schemes, chosen fonts and adding details for screen readers to assits even the visually impaired to enjoy this site.

### *Colour Scheme*

![generated color palette used in the webpage](docs/color-palette/cooler-color-palette.webp)

The colour scheme chosen for this site is made up of three simple colours. This was to keep consistency through out the site but the colours were also chosen for specific reasons.

The dark grey was used for the header and footer to create a border abound the site, aiming to draw the visitors eyes more central.

White was used as the text font colour as it pops against darker shades making the text easy to read and also poijnts out to the visitor that there is information for them to read.

The shade of green was chosen as it is a very earth tne colour, to match with the ethos of the photographer. It is used to surround the text in the site so if a visitor sees the green they will also know there is text for them to read.

### *Typography*

The fonts used in the site were taken from Google fonts,

The fonts used were:

- Josefin sans
- Oswald fonts

The Oswald font is used for titles and pieces of writting that need to be impactful due to the bold, eyecatching nature of the font.
Where as Josefin felt like it flowed nicer and made the text look slightly less blocky and felt it gave flow to the site.

### *image sourcing*

Images for this site were sourced from my own photographs and two websites:

- unsplash
- pexels

Using semantic HTML.
Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
