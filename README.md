## Features

### General features on each page
The website is comprised of three pages which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, gallery & contact).
All Pages on the website have:

A responsive navigation bar at the top of all pages, -further details needed-

A footer which contains social media icon links to facebook, Instagram, Twitter & TikTok. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

### Future Implementations.

---

## Accessibility
I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

Using semantic HTML.
Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
