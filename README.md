## ***User Experience Design (UXD)***

Websites are designed to be accessible for all. LychParlour Photography has been designed in a way to be accesssible.

Layout decisions, colour scheme, fonts and details are suitable for screen readers to assist people with visual impairments, allowing them to enjoy this site.

### *Colour Scheme*

![generated color palette used in the webpage](docs/color-palette/cooler-color-palette.webp)

The colour scheme chosen for this site is made up of three simple colours. This was to keep consistency throughout the site but the colours were also chosen for specific reasons.

The dark grey was used for the header and footer to create a border abound the site, aiming to draw the visitors eyes more toward the centre.

White was used as the text font colour as it pops against darker shades making the text easy to read, and also points out useful and interesting information to the visitor.

The shade of green was chosen as an earth tone to match the ethos of the photographer. It is used to surround the text in the site so if a visitor sees the green they will also know there is text to read.

### *Typography*

The fonts used in the site were taken from Google fonts,

The fonts used were:

- Josefin sans
- Oswald fonts

The Oswald font is used for titles and pieces of writing that need to be impactful due to the bold, eye-catching nature of the font.
Josefin felt like it flowed and made the text look slightly less blocky, adding flow to the entire site.

### *Image Sourcing*

Images for this site were sourced from my own photographs and two websites:

- unsplash
- pexels

## ***Features***

### *General Features*

Website features are the many individual components that make up the site, making it easy to navigate, functional and valuable to visitors. LychParlour photography, like all other sites, include several features including: 

#### *Favicon*

The favicon is a small image that can be seen on the top left of the visitors tab when they have the site open.
It is used to mark the site if the visitor has multiple tabs open in their browser, allowing them to find LychParlour photography easily.
Please see the example of the LychPArlour photgraphy favicon:

![screenshot of tab on broweer](docs/webpage-screenshots/favicon.webp)

#### *Logo & Navbar*

The logo is a symbol or text which identifies the site, this being the bold title in the header next to the navigational bar.
It is big, bold and of contarasting colour to the header background to stand out and to tell the visitor what site they are visiting, making it recognisable.

The website is comprised of three pages which are accessible from the navigation menu (Home, Gallery & Contact).
All Pages on the site have responsive navigation bar at the top which allows ease of movement through the site, with clear headingings so the visitor knows which page the navigation bar will take them too and also show what page they are currently on.

#### *Hero section*

A hero image is a large or oversized web banner image usually towards the top of the page. This prominent place makes the hero section often the first thing visitors see when arriving on the site. This gives them an idea on what the website is about and invites them look into the further content of the site.
Below is an image of the header and hero section:

#### *About Me Section*
This section is a view into the photographer's ethos, why they take the pictures, their style, and invites the visitor to get to know them better in hopes that the visitor would like to hire them or work with the photographer now in the future.
Below is a screenshot from the site showing the about me section:

![Screenshot of About Me section](docs/webpage-screenshots/about-me.webp)

#### *Call To Action*

A call to action is a prompt on a website that tells the visitor to take a specified action. On the LychParlour photography site this is the collection of three images at the bottom of the home page with clickable links on them. This is a request that allows the visitor to learn more about the photographer's services they can click the link or to contact them.
Below is a screenshot from the site showing the call to action images:

A footer is at the bottom of the page, usually includes important information such as a copyright notice for example. The LychParlour photography site footer contains social media icon links to facebook, Instagram, Twitter & TikTok,these open in new tabs so the visitor does not lose the original page.

#### *Gallery*

Having a gallery is a way of integrating images into a website, allowing visitors to see several images clearly at once.
LychParlour photography uses the gallery to show a portfolio of their work, this is to intrigue the visitor and encourage them to hire or collaborate with photographer.

![Screenshot of webpage Gallery page](docs/webpage-screenshots/gallery.webp)

#### *Contact*

This contact page gives the visitor a form to contact the photographer directly with any queries they may have.
The contact page is designed so that the visitor must fill out all sections of the form before they can send their query. This allows the photographer to have contact details so that they may reply to the visitors.

#### *Error 404*

If a visitor tries typing in part of the LychParlour photography websites url and makes a mistake, they will be direceted to the error 404 page.
Error 404 is a status code meaning what the visitor had typed in could not be found.
The LychParlour 404 has a helpful link that will bring the visitor back to the home page so if they do go astray they can find their way back quickly.

### *Future Implementations*

In the future there are some improvements and other features that I would like to add to the website.
Firstly, a store area so that visitors would be able to make purchases directly through the site.
Next, a Newsletter and and membership area where repeat visitors would be able to sign up, keep up to date with the photolgrapher and be offered discounts.
Finally, an addition of some check boxes to the contact form so that the messages from visitors can be organised for an easier response by the photographer

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
