![generated color palette used in the webpage](../LychParlour-photography/assets/images-for-README/color-palette/cooler%20color%20palette.png)

The colour scheme chosen for this site is made up of three simple colours. This was to keep consistency through out the site but the colours were also chosen for specific reasons.

The dark grey was used for the header and footer to create a border abound the site, aiming to draw the visitors eyes more central.

White was used as the text font colour as it pops against darker shades making the text easy to read and also poijnts out to the visitor that there is information for them to read.
